# Quantum Teleportation

This project implements the **quantum teleportation protocol** using Qiskit.  
The goal is to demonstrate how an arbitrary quantum state can be transferred from one qubit (Raees) to another (Inayat) using **entanglement** and **classical communication**, without physically sending the qubit itself.
